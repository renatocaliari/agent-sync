## [Unreleased]

### ✨ New Features

#### Flexible File Sync with Paths Support

**Problem:**  
Previously, agent-sync only synced config files (e.g., `opencode.jsonc`). Users couldn't backup plugins, commands, or other agent-specific files.

**Solution:**  
Added three new sync options in `~/.config/agent-sync/config.yaml`:

1. **`all_files: true`** - Backup entire agent directory
2. **`paths: [...]`** - Backup specific paths/glob patterns
3. **`exclude: [...]`** - Exclude patterns (works with both)

**Example Configuration:**

```yaml
# Backup everything
agents_config:
  opencode:
    sync:
      configs: true
      all_files: true
      exclude:
        - "**/*.lock"
        - "node_modules/**"

# Or backup specific paths
agents_config:
  opencode:
    sync:
      configs: true
      paths:
        - plugins/
        - commands/
        - "**/*.js"
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Glob patterns: `**/*.js`, `plugins/*`, `commands/`
- ✅ Preserves symlinks and file permissions
- ✅ Supports hidden files (.dotfiles)
- ✅ Backward compatible (default: configs only)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/agent_sync/config.py` - Added sync options with defaults
- `src/agent_sync/sync.py` - Added `_stage_agent_files()`, `_copy_directory()`, `_copy_path_pattern()`
- `tests/test_sync_paths.py` - New test file with 6 tests

## [0.15.1] - 2026-03-06

### 🐛 Critical Fix: Extension Skills Not Centralized

**Problem:**
Extension skills (e.g., `~/.config/opencode/superpowers/skills/`) were being moved to `~/.agents/skills/` during `agent-sync skills centralize`, when they should remain in their original locations.

**Solution:**
- Extension skills are now marked with `is_extension: True` flag during scan
- `centralize()` command skips extension skills entirely
- Extension skills only backed up via symlinks during `push`
- Regular skills (e.g., `~/.config/opencode/skills/`) still centralized as expected

### Fixed
- Extension skills incorrectly moved to global directory during centralize
- Skills from `opencode-superpowers` now stay in `~/.config/opencode/superpowers/skills/`
- Extension symlinks preserved and backed up correctly

### Added
- Test: `test_centralize_does_not_move_extension_skills` - ensures extension skills remain in place
- Console output shows "(extension - backup only)" for extension skills during scan

### Migration
If you ran `centralize` with v0.13.0 and extension skills were moved:
```bash
# Skills will be restored on next pull from repo
# Or manually restore from ~/.agents/skills/ to original location
```

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-05

### 🚀 Major Architectural Shift: YAML-Driven Agent Registry

**Philosophy Change:**
- Agent definitions are now data-driven via `agent_registry.yaml`.
- Removed Symlink fallback in favor of a more robust `Native -> Config -> Copy` flow.
- Users can now override the `skills_method` for any agent in their local `config.yaml`.

### Added
- `src/agent_sync/agent_registry.yaml`: Centralized registry for all agent definitions.
- `src/agent_sync/agents/registry_loader.py`: Dynamic loader and validator for the YAML registry.
- `docs/adding-agents.md`: New documentation for adding support for new AI agents.
- `Skills Method` column in `agent-sync agents` command.
- Automatic persistence of the successful `skills_method` in user configuration.

### Changed
- **`BaseAgent` Refactor**: Now a generic class that initializes from YAML data instead of hardcoded subclasses.
- **`SkillsManager` Flow**: 
  1. Priority 1: User override in `config.yaml`.
  2. Priority 2: Registry default method.
  3. Priority 3: Implementation flow (`native` -> `config` -> `copy`).
- **`opencode` Configuration**: Now uses dynamic JSON path navigation (`skills.paths`) defined in the registry.

### Removed
- **Symlink Support**: Fully removed `_create_symlink` and `_create_fallback_symlinks` to improve cross-platform reliability and avoid permission issues.
- All hardcoded agent subclasses (`OpencodeAgent`, `ClaudeCodeAgent`, etc.).

### Migration
If upgrading from v0.6.3:
```bash
# Re-configure agents with the new registry system
agent-sync skills centralize
```
Your successful configuration methods will be automatically saved to `~/.config/agent-sync/config.yaml`.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-04

### 🎯 Major Refactor: Centralized Skills Architecture

**Philosophy Change:**
- Skills now exist ONLY in `~/.agents/skills/` (single source of truth)
- No local copies in agent directories
- Agents configured via native support, config, or symlink

### Changed

- **`_configure_agent()` priority** (NEW ORDER):
  1. **Native support** (pi.dev, qwen-code) - fastest, no setup
  2. **Config update** (opencode) - PREFERRED (explicit, robust, cross-platform)
  3. **Symlink** (claude-code, gemini-cli) - FALLBACK if config fails
  4. **Error** - if no method works

  **Why config is preferred:**
  - ✅ Explicit - visible in config file
  - ✅ Robust - survives reinstalls, doesn't break
  - ✅ Cross-platform - works on Windows
  - ✅ Versionable - can commit to repo
  - ✅ Flexible - can add multiple paths

  **Fallback behavior:**
  - If config fails → tries symlink
  - If symlink fails → returns error
  - No silent failures

- **`centralize()` behavior**:
  - Moves ALL skills to `~/.agents/skills/`
  - Removes ALL local skills from agent directories
  - Configures agents to use centralized location
  - No fallback copy (was creating duplicates)

### Added

- `_cleanup_agent_local_skills()` - Unified cleanup for all agents
  - Removes local skills before configuration
  - Preserves symlinks (like `_global`)
  - Ensures clean agent directories

### Removed

- `_copy_skills()` - No longer needed (was creating duplicates)
- `_cleanup_native_agents_skills()` - Replaced by unified cleanup

### Migration

If upgrading from v0.6.2 or earlier:
```bash
# Re-run centralize to clean up duplicates
agent-sync skills centralize

# Or use cleanup script
./scripts/cleanup-duplicates.sh
```

### Agent Configuration Matrix

| Agent | Method | Priority | Fallback? | Local Skills |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| opencode | Config | 1st choice | → Symlink | ❌ None |
| claude-code | Symlink | 2nd choice | (no config) | ❌ None |
| gemini-cli | Symlink | 2nd choice | (no config) | ❌ None |
| pi.dev | Native | 1st choice | N/A | ❌ None |
| qwen-code | Native | 1st choice | N/A | ❌ None |

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- `_stage_skills()` now removes skills deleted from `~/.agents/skills/`
- `_stage_agent_configs()` now removes configs deleted locally (e.g., `.json` vs `.jsonc`)
- `pull()` console import moved to function level (fixes undefined error)

### Changed
- `push --skills-only` now syncs deletions (not just additions)
- `push --configs-only` now syncs deletions (not just additions)

### Use Cases Fixed
- Delete skill locally → removed from repo on push ✅
- Delete config file locally → removed from repo on push ✅
- Example: remove `opencode.json`, keep `opencode.jsonc` → repo updated ✅

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- `push --skills-only` - Push only skills (not configs)
- `push --configs-only` - Push only configs (not skills)
- `pull --skills-only` - Pull only skills (not configs)
- `pull --configs-only` - Pull only configs (not skills)

### Changed
- Updated README with new push/pull options

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Critical: repo directory creation with error handling and verification
- Check if repo exists on GitHub before creating
- Security warning for public repos with explicit confirmation
- Default to NO for public repo confirmation (safe by default)

### Changed
- `init_repo()` now links to existing repos automatically (if private)
- Public repos require explicit user confirmation with security warning
- Better error messages for directory creation failures

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Create repo directory before use (critical error on `init`)
- Filter `.DS_Store` and hidden files in skill scan
- Fix step numbering in wizard (Step 6 was duplicated)
- `get_summary()` counting all files instead of valid skills

### Changed
- Add symlink support for Gemini CLI (was using fallback copy)
- Verify symlink creation before returning success
- Fall through to other methods if symlink fails

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- `agent-sync config repo` - View/set repository without wizard
- `init --force` - Override existing config

### Security
- `init` blocks if already configured (prevents accidental overwrite)

---

### Fixed
- Secrets sync UI removed (never implemented)

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
